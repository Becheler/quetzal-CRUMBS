Welcome to Quetzal-CRUMBS
=====================================================

This python library is part of the Quetzal framework for iDDC modeling and inference.

IDDC modeling
------------

**iDDC modeling** (*integrated Distributional, Demographic, Coalescent modeling*) is a
methodology for statistical phylo-geography. It relies heavily on spatial models
and methods to explain how past processes (sea level change, glaciers dynamics,
climate modifications) shaped the present spatial distribution of genetic lineages.

To sustain this field, I developed the Quetzal suite:
*  `Quetzal-CoaTL <https://becheler.github.io/softwares/quetzal-CoalTL/home/>`_ : an advanced C++ toolbox to build the Quetzal-EGGS simulators
*  `Quetzal-EGGS <https://github.com/Becheler/quetzal-EGGS>`_ : spatially explicit coalescence-based C++ simulators of genetic diversity
*  Quetzal-CRUMBS: this very Python library that produces EGGS inputs and digest their output
*  `Quetzal-NEST <https://hub.docker.com/r/arnaudbecheler/quetzal-nest>`_ : a Docker container, a reproducible environment that contains all the Quetzal dependencies and allows to run simulations on clusters grids.

   How Quetzal-CRUMBS fit in the Quetzal framework.


* For a quick tour of iDDC, have a look at `my blog post. <https://becheler.github.io/who-am-i/>`_
* For a more formal presentation of the field, see this excellent review by
  `Dennis J. Larsson, Da Pan and Gerald M. Schneeweiss. <https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.38.091206.095702?journalCode=ecolsys>`_

Short list of features:
-----------------------

1. Access the Global Biodiversity Information Facility to retrieve presence points
2. Access the high resolution paleoclimatic database CHELSA to download world files
3. Fit a Species Distribution model and save (persist) the fitted models
4. Distribute the fitted models on cluster nodes and:
    * reconstruct landscape habitability dynamics across millennia
    * perform model averaging
    * fetch and assemble the layers
5. Prepare the dynamic landscape for simulation-based inference
    * adjust the landscape extent and its grid resolution
    * interpolate missing layers if you need to smooth sharp climatic transitions
    * virtualize missing layers if you need to save memory
    * Use the resulting ``landscape.vrt`` file to trick the simulator into believing a layer exists for each generation to simulate
6. Use Quetzal-EGGS spatial simulators, retrieve parameters and simulated genetic data from the output database
7. Use Decrypt to perform robustness analysis of species delimitation methods.
