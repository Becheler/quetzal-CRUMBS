Accessing the GBIF database with Quetzal-CRUMBS
================================================

The `Global Biodiversity Information Facility <https://www.gbif.org/>`_ is an international network
and data infrastructure that provides open access to around 2 billions of occurrence
records.

Why do we need to access GBIF ?
-------------------------------

The first step in IDDC modeling is to reconstruct a dynamic suitability map to inform every
generation (or year, or century) of the simulation of a meta-population.
This suitability map can be derived from a Species Distribution Model
(aka an Environmental Niche Model).

There are many models available out there, and in CRUMBS we use a model averaging over 4 classifiers:

* Random Forest (RF)
* Extra-Tree (ET)
* Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)
* Light Gradient Boosted Machine (LGBM)

These classifiers use spatial predictors (bioclimatic variables from CHELSA) and the following features:

* presence points (*retrieved from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility*)
* pseudo-absence points (*generated from the presence points and the CHELSA Digital Elevation Model*).

Why a scripted approach?
------------------------

To integrate GBIF occurrence records in an IDDC workflow, you need to:

1. download the observational data
2. restrict them to your area of interest (a bounding box around your genetic sample +/- an offset in km)
3. remove the duplicated obsevations
4. download the CHELSA-TraCE21k Digital Elevation Model for the present century
5. filter out the data points that fall in the ocean cells
6. export the remaining points as a shapefile

You could do that manually, but for reproducible science it's nice to have these
steps configured in a script and executed programmatically: this is in essence
what the ``crumbs-get-gbif`` utility does.

Usage
-------

Context
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

To run this command successfully, you will need to start with a set of longitude/latitude points.
That would normally be the coordinates of your DNA samples, but if you want to
reproduce our example then just download our test data points from Github:

1. Go to the `Download Directory <https://download-directory.github.io/>`_ utility
2. Enter this url: ``https://github.com/Becheler/quetzal-CRUMBS/tree/main/tests/data/test_points``
3. Press enter to start the download
4. Extract the archive in your working directory
5. You should find 3 files: move them to your Docker working directory

   * ``test_points.shp``
   * ``test_points.shx``
   * ``test_points.dbf``

 .. warning::
   All these files are necessary. When you transfer shapefiles to different jobs,
   make sure you always transfer all of them, and not only the ``.shp``!


Command
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can then execute this command to retrieve 30 occurrences of *H. binoei* between 1950 and 2022
with a buffer of 2.0 degrees around the bounding box of the sampling points.
The records will be saved as a ``occurrences.shp`` shapefile (and a ``.csv`` for human readibility).

.. Note::
  If you want to retrieve all existing records, use the ``--all`` option and get rid of the ``--limit``.

.. code-block:: bash

   crumbs-get-gbif \
         --species "Heteronotia binoei" \
         --points 'test_points.shp' \
         --limit 30 \
         --year "1950,2022" \
         --buffer 2.0 \
         --output occurrences

Output
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
