Species Distribution Modeling with Quetzal-CRUMBS
================================================

Species distribution modelling (SDM), or equivalently environmental niche modelling (ENM),
(or habitat modelling, or predictive habitat distribution modelling or range mapping!)
is a methodoogy that tries to predict the distribution
of a species across geographic space and time.

Within the iDDC approach, the idea is to reconstruct the landscape habitability
to inform various aspects of a species ecology (like migration rates,fecundity etc).

Although there are many tools existing for SDM, several reasons motivated us to develop our own iDDC-specific resource:

* High-resolution environmental data like CHELSA_TraCE21k are relatively new (2021) and to our
  knowledge there was no other way to easily make CHELSA_TraCE21k data available to SDM
* Developing our own tools for iDDC meant more control on scalability:
    * We could integrate **dask** [Rocklin2015]_ for parallel computing and larger-than-memory data management:
      it allows to work with larger landscapes and to request more nodes with less RAM
    * We use **j√≤blib** for model persistence of fitted classifiers
    * Combined with a dedicated command-line interface, it makes SDM extrapolation to past climates
      easier to script and distribute on High-Throughput Computing Grids.

Fitting a SDM on present climate
--------------------------------

Context
^^^^^^^^^^

We assume that you got some GBIF occurrences records from the previous steps.
This command will fit 4 Classifiers:

* Random Forest (RF)
* Extra-Tree (ET)
* Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGB)
* Light Gradient Boosted Machine (LGBM)

These classifiers use spatial predictors (bioclimatic variables from CHELSA) and the following features:

* presence points (*retrieved from the Global Biodiversity Information Facility*)
* pseudo-absence points (*generated from the presence points and the CHELSA Digital Elevation Model*).

.. note::

   Once fitted, the classifiers are saved in a persistence folder: ``model-persistence/xgb.joblib``.
   These **joblib** files can then be copied for transfer to remote compute nodes
   for distributing the extrapolation of hundreds or thousands of past climate conditions.

.. note::

   An instance of the python SDM object is also saved as a ``my_sdm.bin`` file. It allows to preserve
   the model performance information for model averaging during the extrapolation step.

Bash command
^^^^^^^^^^

.. code-block:: bash

  species='Heteronotia binoei'
  presences='occurrences.shp'
  buffer=2.0
  biovars=dem,bio01

  crumbs-fit-sdm \
        --species $species \
        --presences $presences \
        --nb-backround 30 \
        --variables $biovars \
        --buffer $buffer \
        --cleanup
