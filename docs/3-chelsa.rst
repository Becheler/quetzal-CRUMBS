Accessing the CHELSA-TraCE21k 1km climate timeseries with Quetzal-CRUMBS
================================================

`CHELSA-TraCE21k <https://chelsa-climate.org/chelsa-trace21k/>`_ provides
monthly climate data for temperature and precipitation at 30 arcsec spatial
resolution in 100-yeartime steps for the last 21,000 years.
Based on the reconstructed paleo orography, mean annual
temperature and precipitation was downscaled using the CHELSA V1.2 algorithm ([KARGER]_).

Why do we need CHELSA?
-------------------------------

At phylogeographic scales, climatic variations cause changes in sea-levels and orography,
and as a result have an important impact on the biodiversity, affecting species migration
patterns and ecology. Database with high spatial resolution are a necessity when
processes happening at a small spatial scale (*e.g., two masses of land that get disconnected
by a single small strait*) impact a species ecology (*e.g., isolation of population*)
and have a snowball effect on the downstream levels of biodiversity
at higher spatial scales (*e.g., emergence of two distinct species*).

Models that can link these scales have to rely on high-resolution landscape data.
